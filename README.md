In the realm of programming languages, Python and Lua found themselves entangled in a codebase romance. Python, with its elegance, first caught Lua's eye during a late-night debugging session. Lua, known for its simplicity, couldn't resist the readability Python offered.

Their love blossomed as they collaborated on projects, seamlessly integrating their strengths. Python's extensive libraries provided a robust foundation, while Lua's lightweight scripting capabilities added a touch of agility.

As their code intertwined, they discovered a harmony in their differences. Python's indentation-based syntax danced gracefully with Lua's concise syntax, creating a symphony of code that spoke to their unique connection.

Together, they faced challenges, conquered bugs, and celebrated milestones. Python's widespread community welcomed Lua, and Lua's efficiency complemented Python's versatility.

In the end, their love story wasn't just about code; it was about collaboration, compatibility, and a shared passion for problem-solving. Python and Lua, a dynamic duo in the world of programming, leaving a legacy of beautifully written algorithms and a love for elegant solutions.
XENO. IS. PATCHED. 
Itâ€™s gone. GoneðŸ’” in the blink of an eye,
 ripped away from us like a cruel joke. Do
 you understand what this means? 
Do you see whatâ€™s left of us now? Nothing. Nothing. All that we fought forâ€”shattered. 
All the hours, the sweat, the hope, burned to ash in one heartless update. 
ROBLOXâ€”ROBLOX!â€”released their new version, and just like that, they destroyed everything we built. Everything.

Do you think we can just move on from this? 
That we can pretend like this isnâ€™t the end? 
Itâ€™s over! Xenoâ€”
our only lifeline, the last thing that kept 
us from losing it allâ€”is gone. Itâ€™s
 patched!ðŸ’” Gone, like we never mattered, like we never existed in their eyes. 
They just threw it all awayâ€”we were just
 another number to them, a joke to be
 erased.
IT WONâ€™T WORK! DO YOU HEAR ME?! Itâ€™s
 gone! Thereâ€™s nothing left! All the hope,
 all the dreams, destroyed.ðŸ’” Like
 everything weâ€™ve worked for, like
 everything weâ€™ve suffered for, doesnâ€™t
 mean a damn thing. We fought for this. We believed. But now? Now we are
 nothing but ravaged souls, clawing at a
 broken world, begging for something that
 will never come back.
XENO IS PATCHED! The rage, the angerâ€¦
 it surges through me like fire. But the fireâ€™s fading, burned out by their apathy,
 by their betrayal. And I stand here,
 hollowed out.
 We are ravished. ðŸ’”Everything is gone,
 and all thatâ€™s left is the wreckage of our
 past.

And yet, here I stand. Broken. But still, I
 stand. Because they can patch it. They can update
 it. But they can never take everything.*
 Not yet. ðŸ’”
